# abalone-age-prediction-DNN
Abalone-Age-Prediction-DNN is a Python project hosted on GitHub that provides a deep neural network (DNN) based solution to predict the age of abalone from their physical measurements. The project is designed to help beginners understand the basics of DNNs and how they can be applied to regression problems.

# Features:

Dataset: The project uses the Abalone dataset, which consists of 4177 samples of abalone, each with 8 attributes including sex, length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, and age.

Deep Neural Networks: The project includes a pre-built DNN model that can be used to make predictions on the Abalone dataset.

Data preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for analysis, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Model evaluation: The project includes tools to evaluate the performance of the DNN model, including metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.

Visualization: The project includes visualization tools to help beginners understand how DNNs work, including visualizations of the model architecture, loss and accuracy curves, and feature importance.

Customizable: The project is designed to be customizable, allowing beginners to modify the code and adapt it to their specific needs.
